# Final Solution: Fixing "relation 'блок' does not exist" Error

## Root Cause Identified

After several iterations of troubleshooting, we've identified the precise issue:

**The application is looking for a table named `блок` (Cyrillic characters) but the database has a table named `block` (Latin characters).**

This is a character encoding/table naming issue specific to this application. The key diagnostic clue was in the error message:

```
psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: отношение "блок" не существует
СТРОКА 2: ИЗ блока  
```

The SQLAlchemy ORM is generating SQL that refers to `блок` (Cyrillic) rather than `block` (Latin).

## Comprehensive Solution

We've implemented several targeted solutions to fix this specific issue:

### 1. Emergency Direct Table Creation

The `emergency_cyrillic_table.py` script:
- Directly creates a table with the exact Cyrillic name `блок`
- Adds a sample record to ensure it works
- Sets proper UTF-8 encoding 
- Runs first in both build and prestart processes

### 2. Model Patching

Two approaches to ensure the models use the correct table name:

- `patch_models_file.py`: Directly modifies the models.py file to add `__tablename__ = "блок"` to the Block class
- `fix_block_model.py`: Runtime patch that modifies the Block.__tablename__ attribute directly

### 3. ORM Mapping Check

The `check_orm_mapping.py` script now:
- Analyzes the actual SQL query generated by SQLAlchemy
- Verifies if it's using Cyrillic table names
- Tests direct SQL queries to both `block` and `блок` tables
- Creates a custom model if needed

### 4. Multi-Layer Strategy

- Initial emergency fix runs first
- Multiple approaches to fixing the model
- Both SQL and ORM-based solutions
- Verification at each step

## Deployment Steps

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Render.com 
3. Monitor the logs - you should see the Cyrillic table being created successfully

## Verification

After the service starts, you should be able to verify that:
1. The homepage loads without errors
2. The Cyrillic `блок` table is present in the database
3. Records can be created and retrieved from the table

## Long-term Fix

For a more permanent solution:

1. Consider modifying the `app/models.py` file to explicitly set the table name for all models:

```python
class Block(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'блок'  # Explicitly specify the Cyrillic table name
    # rest of model definition...
```

2. Ensure consistent character encoding settings in your database configuration.

3. When making database schema changes in the future, be aware of this Cyrillic table naming pattern.
